trying to figure out packages and strucutre. 

top level folder contains three folders:
- shape folder contains shapes.py which contains a single function shape_maker()
- mesh slicer contains an information in and out folder, and a script to turn one into the other
- deformation has a script that attempts to load the data from mesh slicer, the function from shapes.py and report the result.
